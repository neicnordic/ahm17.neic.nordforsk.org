title: "The Magics of Jupyter Notebooks, revealed"
---

This tutorial will take you on a journey through the wondrous world of [Jupyter
Notebooks](http://jupyter.org). You will learn the basics of interactive data
exploration using high-performance numerical libraries and parallel engines,
high-level data visualization packages, interactive widgets and so called
*magics*, which significantly enhance the power of Jupyter Notebooks. To get
the most out of this workshop, some previous exposure to the Python programming
language is recommended. To take active part in the tutorial it is also
recommended that workshop participants will have installed Jupyter on their
laptops (for example through the
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview) or
[Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) packages).
