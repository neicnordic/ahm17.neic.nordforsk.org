title: "Intro to Kubernetes and hands-on for deploying a Jupyter notebook"
---

This tutorial will provide brief introduction to
[Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) concepts and its architecture. Participants
will later deploy a Jupyter notebook application on Kubernetes running on their
laptop first and then the same application on Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.
They will also see how we can automate DNS, SSL certs too when deploying
application on Kubernetes. The list of required software to be pre-installed on
your laptop will be provided before the workshop.

Basic understanding of containers ([Docker](https://www.docker.com)) can be
helpful for this tutorial. The participants need to have Linux or Mac OS X
running on their laptop, as we are not going to support windows during hands
on.
