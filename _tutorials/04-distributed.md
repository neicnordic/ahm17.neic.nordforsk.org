title: "Distributed work - Show me your toolset!"
---
Working in a distributed team sucks because you need to be really transparent
with everything you do, or everything will fall to pieces.

But it's also great! Because now that you are being really transparent with
everything you do, everyone can now see what good work you have done, and how
you did it, and why you did it, and who was involved, and where you are going!

This workshop is about sharing good tools and routines that really work -for
you, in practice- to make your work in a distributed team go more smoothly,
helping you avoid confusion and stall time, and making it so that you can do
less boring sh\*t and focus on getting stuff done!

What are the good tools? What are their merits? What are the pitfalls?
What are some bad tools? Why did you try them out? Why didn't they work?

Examples:

- How Joel works with Google docs in stakeholder engagement for Tryggve1/2, live minutes.
- How Radovan works with Trello to track work in NeIC 2017 conference program.
- How Joel uses Google Hangouts to set up *bad* video meetings that lock out _everyone_ at the last minute.
- How Joel wrote the [NeIC policies](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Category:Policy) to help you write less reports.
- How You can use Slack and grep to recall what people said on that important subject one year ago.
- How YOUR_NAME_HERE uses SERVICE_X to do GOOD_THING_1.
- How SOMEBODY_ELSE uses SERVICE_Y to do GOOD_THING_2.
- ...

Please let us know on slack [#ahm](https://neic.slack.com/messages/ahm/) which examples you're interested in hearing
about, and we'll try and prepare something to show and discuss! Please feel
free to propose NAMES, SERVICES and THINGS that you want to know more about,
and we'll try to make it fly!

Ideally we want more names on the list above, but there's also this stuff that I
could talk about: Why Tryggve does not develop draft agendas on the internal
wiki anymore? How Joel uses [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout) to mass create PDFs from stuff on
Google Drive (and pdftk to concatenate them into a single pdf). How Joel works
with action points in wiki and trello to ensure stuff (eventually) gets done
(like he promised people he would :-).
