### Intended participants

The intended participants of the AHM are personnel contracted in NeIC
operations or projects. If you are engaged in a NeIC project and not sure
whether you should participate, please contact your team leader.  The program
will include a major component of social networking, attempting to mitigate the
effects of the completely distributed nature of NeIC and facilitate excellent
working relations.


### Other participants

Interested members of project steering groups or reference group and
stakeholder fora who want to participate in the discussions, socialize with
NeIC and see what work in NeIC is like on the inside are warmly welcome to join
the AHM. However, co-locating official meetings in such groups to this event is
strongly discouraged, in order not to distract staff away from the prioritized
content. On the other hand, network connectivity has proven excellent at this
location, so for any sessions that do not directly concern such delegates, time
can still very likely be usefully spent doing other productive work.


### Family policy

It is not recommended to bring your family during the meeting. If you want to
explore the location with your family you're welcome to do so before or after
the AHM. NeIC, however, will not arrange any travel or accommodation for that.
